    data-notes: Radiocarbon dates are one of the most shared archaeological data. Accompanied by archaeological contexts, these absolute dates play a crucial role in constructing large-scale models of human activities and classifying cultural groups across different periods and regions. The NeoNet project unites archaeologists from diverse geographic areas, with a specific focus on the transition from hunter-gatherer societies to early farming communities. As part of this initiative, we have compiled and meticulously curated a substantial collection of radiocarbon dates, accessible through the NeoNet app—an R Shiny online application. Today, our aim is to elucidate how our methodology addresses research questions and adheres to the FAIR principle.

::: notes
The NeoNet app is an open-source R Shiny interactive web application designed to enhance the study of radiocarbon data. It facilitates research by providing selection tools for spatial information, chronology, and date accuracy. The map interface offers a flexible and multi-scalar window, enabling the study of the dynamics of transitions between last hunter-gatherers and early farmers <br> NB: prepare the map: Global view / clustered / ortho ; Explode cluster / ungroup / OSM

To facilitate dataset curation, it has been divided into two parts based on river basins: NeoNet Atl, focusing on the Atlantic region (in blue), and NeoNet Med, dedicated to the North Central-Western Mediterranean Basin (in red).

::: notes
The decision to partition by river basins is grounded in two primary considerations: it allows for the systematic breakdown, or hierarchical decomposition, of river basins into interconnected and nested components; watersheds are crucial as spatial analysis units, facilitating mathematical modeling that incorporates key concepts such as catchment area, thalweg (shortest path), and natural boundaries.

      lengthMenu = list(c(10, 50, -1),

  )
```

::: notes
*Kervouric*. These datasets have been limited to essential radiocarbon date information: the date, period, location, archaeological unit, type of material dated, and bibliographical references. NeoNet Atl and Med include approximately 4,000 radiocarbon dates from around 3,000 distinct archaeological layers, along with about 800 sites mentioned in bibliographical references. These dates and archaeological contexts are backed by roughly 600 different bibliographical sources.

::: notes
For instance, the Défilé de Donzère is a narrow pass in the Rhone valley, extending from North to South, located between the Alps in the east and the Massif Central in the west. In this area, the southern part has a Mediterranean climate (`Csa` - Temperate, dry and hot summer), while the northern part experiences a continental climate (`Cfb` - Temperate, no dry season, warm summer). It is worth noting that the Rhône River served as a cultural frontier during the Late Neolithic.

::: notes
An user create a selection window around the Défilé, specifically choosing dates from the Late Mesolithic (LM) and Early Neolithic (EN) periods, with a standard deviation (SD) of less than 130. Applying these filters, the dataset will contain 70 sites and 353 dates. These dates can be calibrated on the fly by selecting one of them and accessing the calib (calibration) panel.

::: notes
Dates can be aggregated and seriated by periods (shown here), sites and periods, archaeological layer (PhaseCode), or plotted individually. However, a large number of dates will overwhelm the R Shiny server and may result in an error in this panel. This is one of the limitations of R for managing big data.

::: notes
The Shiny app also includes documentation and other functions for calculating various features, including:

-   Spatial distributions
-   SPDs (Summed Probability Distributions)
-   Isochrones (considered an effective way to visually represent the diffusion in time and space within a single non-animated map)
-   Harrix matrices

## Conclusion

<center>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoometh/neonet/master/results/neonet-data-2023-09-24-isochr.png){width="600"}</center>

-   Open Data, Open Source, Open Access
-   Scalable, Incrementable, Reusable, Analyzable

::: notes
-   Neonet offers an app and curated datasets of radiocarbon dates for the Mesolithic / Neolithic transition, currently in South-Central and South-Western Europe
-   The dataset is OD, the app and management functions are OSrc and OA. Compliant with OSci
-   The app allows a multiscalar approach, the partition in river basins makes it easily incrementable, being compliant with OS makes also the framework reusable, and side functions make easier the analysis. These features collectively enhance the potential reproducibility of radiocarbon analysis, contributing to the development of consensual assumptions about the temporal dynamics of the spread of farming

## Perspectives

<center>![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoometh/neonet/master/doc/img/panel_map_export_todo.png){width="600" style="horizontal-align: middle;"}</center>

-   Extending, enhancing data and data re-usability
-   Build sites' Harris matrices and run Bayesian with *prior* information

::: notes
Perspectives are many:

-   Watersheds partition is highly modular (hierarchical decomposition) and makes easy the extension of the dataset to other river basins. We need IT development to offer the option of different geographical windows at the same time (here at the South and the North of the Defile). That will allow to contrast different areas. FAIRability can still be improved: even curated and standardised, the NeoNet dataset certainly still contains error. Managing feedback from users would be a plos.
-   We would like to construct the Harris matrices of different site and run Bayesian statistics to better the modeling
