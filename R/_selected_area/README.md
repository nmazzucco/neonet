# Export selection geometries

Uses a minimal leaflet app example to export geometries of selections areas (rectangles, polygons, etc.) created with `addDrawToolbar`

* `app.R`: the leaflet app
* `selectionShape.Rdata`: the exported selection geometry (a rectangle)
* `selectionShaperead.R`: an R script to manage the selection geometry and convert it into a `sf` object
